#Snake Game

A simple Snake game implemented in C++ using console graphics. The game tracks the player's score and maintains a high score across sessions.

#Project Overview

This project is a classic Snake game built using C++ and designed to run in the console. It showcases fundamental programming concepts such as arrays, input handling, file operations, and game logic implementation.

#Key Features

Dynamic Gameplay: The snake moves in response to user input and grows when consuming food.

#Score Tracking: Maintains the highest score across sessions using file storage (score.txt).

#Speed Adjustment: The game speed increases as the player's score increases.

#Randomized Fruit Placement: Ensures fruit does not spawn inside the snake.

#Technologies Used

C++: Core programming language

File Handling: Uses text files to store and retrieve high scores

#Console Manipulation: Uses conio.h and windows.h for real-time input and screen clearing (Windows-only)
