# How to Run Your Modern Snake Game

## WORKING VERSION - FIXED GAME LOGIC

The game logic has been fixed! Here's how to run it:

## Quick Start (Recommended)

```bash
cd /home/oneknight/projects/Snake-Game

# Build and run (easiest way)
make run
```

The game will start immediately with proper controls and logic!

## Alternative: Manual Build

```bash
# Build
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o snake_modern_fixed snake_modern_fixed.cpp

# Run
./snake_modern_fixed
```

## Game Features

### Working Features
‚úì **Smooth Controls** - WASD movement that responds properly
‚úì **Colorful Graphics** - Green snake, red fruit, yellow power-ups
‚úì **Power-ups** - 5 types that actually work!
‚úì **Score Tracking** - Displays current and high score
‚úì **Progressive Speed** - Gets faster as you score
‚úì **Play Again** - Restart without closing the program

### Power-Ups (Yellow Letters)
- **S** = Speed Boost (faster movement)
- **D** = Double Points (2x score for limited time)
- **I** = Invincible (walk through walls and yourself)

- **R** = Shrink (remove 3 segments)

## Controls

### During Game

2. ‚ùå Menu system was causing the game to exit immediately
3. ‚ùå Configuration files causing initialization issues
4. ‚ùå Complex header dependencies

### Solutions Applied
1. ‚úÖ Fixed non-blocking terminal input with proper fcntl()
2. ‚úÖ Removed complex menu system - game starts immediately
3. ‚úÖ Self-contained game logic in single file
4. ‚úÖ Simplified terminal setup/restore
5. ‚úÖ Fixed collision detection
6. ‚úÖ Fixed power-up spawn and collision
7. ‚úÖ Proper tail movement logic

## Versions Available

```bash
make run-linux
# OR  
./snake_game_linux
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Game doesn't respond to keys
**Solution:** The fixed version handles this correctly now. Just use `make run`

### Issue: Colors not showing
**Solution:** Your terminal may not support ANSI colors. The game still works!

### Issue: Game too fast/slow
**Solution:** Speed automatically adjusts with your score. Start slow, gets faster!

### Issue: Can't see the snake
**Solution:** Make sure your terminal is at least 32x25 characters

## Gameplay Tips

1. **Start Slow**: Wait at the title screen, then start when ready
2. **Collect Power-ups**: Yellow letters give you special abilities
3. **Use Invincible**: The 'I' power-up lets you phase through walls temporarily
4. **Double Points**: Stack 'D' power-up with lots of fruit eating
5. **Don't Shrink Too Much**: 'R' power-up can make you too small

## Technical Details

### What Makes This Work
- **Non-blocking Input**: fcntl() with O_NONBLOCK
- **Proper Terminal Setup**: termios configuration
- **Fixed Game Loop**: draw ‚Üí input ‚Üí logic ‚Üí sleep
- **Collision Detection**: Proper boundary and self-collision checks
- **Memory Management**: Vector-based tail with proper sizing

### Performance
