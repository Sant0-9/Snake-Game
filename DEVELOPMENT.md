# Snake Game Development Guide

## Current Status

Your Snake Game is a working C++ console-based implementation with the following features:
- ✅ Basic snake movement and growth
- ✅ Score tracking with file persistence
- ✅ Collision detection (walls and self)
- ✅ Randomized fruit placement
- ✅ Speed increase with score

## Quick Start

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build the Linux version (recommended)
make

# Run the game
make run

# Or build and run manually
g++ -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -O2 -o snake_game_linux main_linux.cpp
./snake_game_linux
```

### Controls
- **WASD**: Move the snake
- **P**: Pause the game
- **R**: Restart the game (when paused)
- **X**: Quit the game

## Development Environment Setup

### Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (g++ or clang++)
- Make (for build automation)
- Git (for version control)

### Project Structure
```
Snake-Game/
├── main.cpp              # Original Windows version
├── main_linux.cpp        # Cross-platform Linux version
├── Makefile              # Build configuration
├── score.txt             # Score persistence file
├── README.md             # Project documentation
└── DEVELOPMENT.md        # This development guide
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### 1. Making Changes
```bash
# Edit the source code
vim main_linux.cpp  # or your preferred editor

# Build and test
make clean && make run
```

### 2. Version Control
```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add new feature: pause functionality"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## 🎯 Next Development Steps

### Immediate Improvements (Easy)
1. **Better UI/UX**
   - Add game over screen with restart option
   - Improve visual design with colors/ASCII art
   - Add welcome screen with instructions

2. **Enhanced Features**
   - Add sound effects (beep sounds)
   - Implement different difficulty levels
   - Add power-ups (speed boost, invincibility)

3. **Code Quality**
   - Split into multiple files (SnakeGame.h, SnakeGame.cpp)
   - Add proper error handling
   - Implement configuration file support

### Advanced Features (Medium)
1. **Graphics Enhancement**
   - Port to SDL2 for better graphics
   - Add animations and smooth movement
   - Implement different themes/skins

2. **Game Modes**
   - Time attack mode
   - Survival mode
   - Multiplayer (local)

3. **Platform Support**
   - Web version (using Emscripten)
   - Mobile version (using SDL2)
   - GUI version (using Qt or GTK)

### Professional Features (Hard)
1. **Advanced Architecture**
   - Implement proper game engine structure
   - Add plugin system for mods
   - Create level editor

2. **Online Features**
   - Leaderboards
   - Multiplayer over network
   - Cloud save synchronization

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Build Issues
```bash
# If you get "command not found" errors
sudo apt-get install build-essential  # Ubuntu/Debian
sudo yum install gcc-c++              # CentOS/RHEL

# If you get permission errors
chmod +x snake_game_linux
```

### Runtime Issues
- **Game doesn't respond to input**: Make sure terminal supports non-blocking input
- **Score file not created**: Check file permissions in the directory
- **Game runs too fast/slow**: Adjust the sleep duration in the Logic() function
