### Before
```
Single monolithic file
Global variables
Procedural code
No separation of concerns
```

### After
```
Modular header files
Object-oriented classes
Separated concerns:
  - Game logic (modern_snake.cpp)
  - Graphics (colors.h)
  - Configuration (config.h)
  - Power-ups (powerups.h)
  - UI (menu.h)
  - Audio (sound.h)
  - Scoring (leaderboard.h)
```

## Technical Achievements

### Modern C++ Features Used
- Classes and OOP
- STL containers (vector, map)
- Enums and enum classes
- Lambda functions
- Chrono library for timing
- Threading for sound
- Smart pointers concepts
- RAII pattern
- Template-like configuration

### Best Practices
- Header guards
- Const correctness
- Initialization lists
- Member initialization
- Default constructors
- Proper memory management
- File I/O with error handling
- Clean function separation

## How to Run

### Quick Start
```bash
# Modern version (full features)
make run
./modern_snake

# Simple version (classic gameplay)
make run-linux
./snake_game_linux
```

### Build Options
```bash
